// 4. Create a BankAccount class with balance and interestRate properties, and deposit() and withdraw() methods. Add a transactionHistory property that is 
//an array of objects representing each transaction made on the account, with properties for type (either "deposit" or "withdrawal"), amount, 
//and date ({type: "withdrawal", amount: amount, date: new Date().toLocaleDateString()}). Implement deposit() and withdraw() methods that add new transactions to
// the transactionHistory array. Implement a get transactionHistory() getter method that returns a copy of the transaction history array, and a get 
//currentBalance() getter method that calculates and returns the current balance of the account based on the transaction history.

class BankAccount {
    Constructor(balance, interestRate) {
