An accordion in UI/UX refers to a user interface design element that helps organize and display content in a compact and structured manner. It's commonly used to present a list of items or sections where each item can be expanded or collapsed individually to reveal or hide additional content. This interaction pattern is particularly useful when dealing with a limited amount of screen space while still needing to present a variety of information or options.

You can see a few examples of accordion components implemented in Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/
You can use Bootstrap's code for inspiration but blindly copying it would not work :) 

For this homework, pick one of the 3 examples and try write you own code from scratch (you'll have to create HTML, CSS, JS files).
